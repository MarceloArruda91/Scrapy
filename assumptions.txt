Assumptions for the Challenge
I had to update the Twisted package version to Twisted==22.10.0 to ensure compatibility with Scrapy.

The spider should exclusively traverse the h3 categories during the crawling process.

Since all pages adhere to a uniform structure, I opted for utilizing a recursive function to simplify the iteration process.

Data Treatment:

Artist:
I processed the data to extract only the artists names, excluding their specific artist type.
In cases where the Artist field contained "after some artist," I removed the "after some artist" portion.

Title:
I did not consider instances where the titles were marked as "untitled."
However, if a title began with "untitled" and was followed by additional text, I removed the "untitled" part.

Dimensions:
When multiple dimensions in centimeters were present, I extracted only the first occurrence, which typically represents image/sight/plate dimensions.
In cases with a single centimeter value, I returned None and left the field unfilled.
