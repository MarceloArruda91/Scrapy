Assumptions for the Challenge

Had to downgrade Twisted to 22.10.0 because I was getting this error:
AttributeError: 'AsyncioSelectorReactor' object has no attribute '_handleSignals'

To streamline the iteration process, I employed a recursive function, given the uniform structure of all pages.



Data Treatment:

Artist:
Extracted artists' names while omitting their specific artist type.
Removed the "after some artist" portion from the Artist field when present.

Title:
Excluded titles marked as "untitled."
If a title started with "untitled" and had additional text, I removed the "untitled" part.
Any remaining text enclosed in brackets or curly brackets was appended to the description and not fill the Title.

Dimensions:
Extracted the first occurrence of dimensions in centimeters, typically representing image/sight/plate dimensions.
For cases with a single centimeter value, I returned None and left the field unfilled.

Description:
When the title was identified as a description, I appended it.
